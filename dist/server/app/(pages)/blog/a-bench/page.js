Fall break last semester. It was the first time that I had come home from college and my dad and I decided to drive around after dinner. We ended up driving to my school, church, and skating rink which just so happened to represent the three core areas of my life before I left for college. When we got to my rink, we parked in the empty parking lot. It was around 8pm and we were the only ones there. Outside of the entrance to my rink sat a wooden bench. My dad ended up sitting on the bench and just sat there for a while. I was still standing near the car when I turned and saw him sitting there. In that moment, I was hit with the reality that he would not always be there and that time was only moving faster forward. I realized I hadn't appreciated my parents–and specifically, my dad–enough and that as much as I had to adjust to college, they also had to learn how to live with their daughter being states away, no longer being the little kid they always saw her as. It was a profound moment of gratitude for me. My dad and I are very similar in a lot of ways that will often lead to us butting heads (about what I couldn't even tell you). Most of the arguments that arose were very pointless but occasionally we would often let our tempers get the best of us for days, leading to petty comebacks that were fueled by annoyance and anger. I think when I saw him sitting on that bench, I saw a man who only ever wanted to protect me and care for me. And while I couldn't see it in high school, my dad was just as full of a human, created by God, as I was. He was not just my father, he too was a child of God, living his life the best he could with the gifts that God had given him. That moment really urged me to be grateful for all he was and recognize the valuable time that we had together. My hope for this piece to convey a heart of gratitude towards one of God's many gifts for us. I love you dad."})]})]})})})}}};var t=require("../../../../webpack-runtime.js");t.C(e);var __webpack_exec__=e=>t(t.s=e),a=t.X(0,[273,639,491],()=>__webpack_exec__(3809));module.exports=a})();
