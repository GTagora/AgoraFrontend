Not just a life for God or a life seeking God, but one that seeks to be with Him. Inherently, I believe a life with God implies that I do things for Him and that I seek Him in all things, but I believe that this concept of “with” stretches even further beyond. I think it’s how I choose to think and live on the daily. What is the first response in my head when I experience something? Who is the first one I turn to in peace or turmoil? In idleness or commotion? Why am I doing the things I do? Simple yet multi-faceted questions such as this. I believe a life with God seeks to have God be at the center of every aspect of my life. In walks. In boredom. In crying out. In sorrow. In joy. In victory. In everything. I’ve come to slowly see God in all these aspects of my life as I’ve continued to walk with Him and there is still so much more to see and learn.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"With that said, here is An Anthology of Joy and Thought Vol. 1. Authored and taken by me, Stephen Noh, but ultimately by the Lord, my Father in Heaven.

Nothing in here is heavily edited, it is merely a reflection of what I’ve come to reminisce on at the moment.
