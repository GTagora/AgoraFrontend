b:T433,For a little background, go outside and look at a tree. Look carefully at its branches or trunk. You’ll notice those little tiny branches with some tiny leaves. Those are known as tree suckers. These tree suckers suck up life and nutrients to the tree but end up amounting to nothing. In a gardener’s perspective, they also prevent certain plants from bearing fruit, as they drain all the nutrients. Then comes a process of pruning. This process involves completely removing this tree sucker by cutting it off the tree. Realistically, this tree sucker is a branch of the tree and is still a part of the tree as much as any other healthy branch. Sometimes I think about the passage in Matthew 5:27-30 about lust. I know the context here is not the same but with the same idea of tearing out your eyes, I see the concept of pruning to be similar as if you’re getting a body part torn from you. That’s how painful I see pruning to be. Yet, these trees, (not by choice, of course, while we have a choice) go through this process to hopefully one day bear wonderful fruit.2:["$","div",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"article_main__4ZyjP","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"article_container__A9vdu","children":[["$","$L8",null,{"href":"/blog/an-anthology","className":"article_breadcrumb__OA_tg","children":"An Anthology of Joy and Thought Vol. 1"}],["$","$La",null,{"className":"article_image__o14y4","src":"/blog/an-anthology/13.jpg","width":600,"height":600,"alt":"article image"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"article_credit__q97Uu","children":"Image: Stephen Noh"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"article_title__8D_Zi","children":"prune"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"article_text__zMTW1","children":["One day I was on one of my daily walks and I saw this tree in my neighborhood with a dying branch.
